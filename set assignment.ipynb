    "In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is a built-in data type that represents a mathematical set. The elements in a set can be of different data types such as integers, floats, strings, or even other sets. However, a set itself is mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements from it, but the individual elements must be immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of sets in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique Elements: A set does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add an element that already exists in the set, it will not be added again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unordered Collection: Sets are unordered, meaning the elements are not stored in a specific order. Therefore, you cannot access elements from a set using indexing or slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable: Sets are mutable, allowing you to add or remove elements. You can modify a set after it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashable Elements: Elements of a set must be hashable. Immutable data types like integers, floats, strings, and tuples are hashable and can be elements of a set. However, lists and dictionaries, which are mutable, cannot be elements of a set."
